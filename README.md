# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Description

Developed as part of Meta's Coursera Front-End Development program, this project serves as the culmination of the Front-End Development Track.

The website highlights the implementation of a booking application on the Little Lemon platform. Utilizing React Components, it demonstrates proficiency in leveraging React for website development, along with the incorporation of API calls.

It's important to note that, as of now, the only functional aspect of the website is the Reserve a Table feature, alongside its aesthetically pleasing design.
